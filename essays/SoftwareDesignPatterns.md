Design patterns are like recipes for software development, providing a standard approach to common programming problems. Just as a recipe provides a set of steps to follow in order to create a delicious dish, a design pattern provides a set of best practices to follow when designing software solutions.

Just as a chef may modify a recipe to suit their taste or to adapt to available ingredients, a programmer can modify a design pattern to suit the specific requirements of a project. However, just as a chef should understand the basic techniques and principles of cooking before modifying a recipe, a programmer should have a solid understanding of design patterns before attempting to modify them.

One example of a design pattern is the Singleton pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful in situations where multiple instances of a class would cause issues. Another example of a design pattern, I have used, is the “wrapper” pattern. Since the parameters of one of my functions required a very specific type of variable, I first had to wrap my function in another class to make it usable by the function.


In conclusion, design patterns are like recipes for software development, providing a standard approach to common programming problems. By using design patterns, programmers can save time and improve the quality of their code.
