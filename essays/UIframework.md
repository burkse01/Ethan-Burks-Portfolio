UI frameworks are a tool which allows programmers to focus on designing a website rather than stressing about urls. I think that UI frameworks are a necessity in modern web development, as creating everything from scratch would be a huge waste of time. By learning UI frameworks, developers are able to spend there time improving a websites user interface, instead of worrying too much about the clunky aspects of HTML. 

HTML as a language can be repetitive, and at times frustrating to format. By using UI elements whose behaviour is more user friendly, we can make UIâ€™s much better with much less work. In addition, these sites are often more visually appealing, as a result of them being formatted better.
  
In short UI frameworks are great tools which allow developers to streamline their design process. UI frameworks are great for faster, higher quality development.
