The Bad:

When trying to understand a problem, asking a smart question can be the difference between success and failure. Asking a smart question allows potential answerers get a full context when answering a question. To answer a technical question in programing is often more difficult if the proposer of the question has left it’s parameters ambiguous. It is not enough to simply post a series of screenshots or snippets of code and ask “why doesnt this work?” It’s also not enough to post a question with a screenshot and poor context. In [one post I read](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75254669/how-to-predict-next-trade-based-on-past-trade-history), the poster simply took a screenshot of some data and said “want to predict next trade based on past trade data”. No context on the datas meaning, nor any explanation of what his specific problem was, just posting a question out there, and asking other people to do the work.

The Good:

Conversely, an example of a good question would be one which asks a specific question about a solvable problem, while also giving the reader the full context of the situation. [In another question I read](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20279484/how-to-access-the-correct-this-inside-a-callback), the user is having trouble accessing a property of one of his classes while using javascript. When he poses the question, he includes all of his code, as well as explains several solutions to his problem. He the masks how to access the proper object, and has his question answered with a detailed explanation. It is unsurprising, then, that both the question and the answer in this post received several thousand likes, showing both that the question was useful to many people, and that an answer was possible and useful.
