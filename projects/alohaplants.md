From the Aloha Plants Website:

'The “Aloha Plants” website allows you to search and view different native plants, forums, and community projects. When searching for native plants it will provide information on how to grow native species and the specific areas to cultivate the plants. This aids the fauna in Hawaii by giving resources to the community to allow them to increase biodiversity by hand. The user will also be exposed to various resources that foster community interaction such as the forums page and community projects page on the website. This will also give the community information to grow their own foods, which will allow the user’s within the community to potentially alleviate the hawaii food crisis.The website will also allow creator users to add in unlogged native plant species to provide users a new native plant variety to grow. This will allow us to log all plant species in a cloud environment, which can be provided to scientific institutes such as the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources and The University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Botany Department.' 

This was a collaberative project I worked on in ICS 314. I focused on implementing the search function of the website, as well as designing the McCafe tests, and implementing those tests. The project used the meteor platform with the react framework.
