summary: "An app I worked on in Highschool to help teachers and students manage their schedule"
---



During my senior year I participated in an Independent Study project in which I designed a prototype application to assist students and teachers in the organization of class schedules. I created survey questions to send out to teachers and students in order to get user input on what they'd want out of a scheduling app. Designed a prototype which was presented to the principal and dean. 

The app itself was meant to parse through several formated csv files, then merge them into one list, allowing students to see their schedule, homework and classwork in one place.

After graduation, I had to cease work on the project. Most of the development I was able to do was in Javascript and html using the Cordova framework.
