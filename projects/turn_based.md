summary: "Turn Based Strategy Game in Unity"
---

Since the summer I have been working on my own game in Unity off and on. The game is meant to be a turn based strategy game in a similar vein to the Civilization games. Most of the work I've finished has been designing the architecture of the game and getting a working user interface. All coding was done in C#, and all development was done in Unity. 

The most difficult aspect of the project so far has been maintaining a consistent and reasonable structure for the project as a whole. The project has expanded my knowledge of C#, and challenged my ability to design a program architecture.
